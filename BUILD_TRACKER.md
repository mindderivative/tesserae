# Build Tracker

Updated after every milestone/phase/stage/step completion, kept in sync with `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Status legend: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ not started.

**Milestones 1-6 are seeded, written after the fact (2026-09-23):** this file didn't exist when Tesserae's first 6 commits landed (2026-09-19 through 2026-09-21) -- their real history is reconstructed honestly from those commits' own messages and the code as it exists today, not presented as if this tracker had been running from day one.

**Just closed:** M6 — `tre` v0.3.0 renamed the declarative `style.flex_direction` values (`Row`/`Column` → `Horizontal`/`Vertical` — "row"/"column" collided with spreadsheet/datasheet vocabulary). Tesserae's own `.venv` was still on `tre` 0.2.0 and every example/test YAML used the old values; updated to current `tre` and fixed all 7 affected files. 22/22 tests and all 3 real examples pass again.

**Up next:** M7 (this milestone) — bootstrapping the same real documentation infrastructure `tre` already has (this file, a real MkDocs site, `PLAN.md`/`LOG.md`), per the user's own explicit direction that Tesserae-scoped work is tracked in the Tesserae repo, not folded into `tre`'s own tracker. After that: the real widget/component catalog (composing MD3 components in Python from `tre`'s own primitives) and a YAML-level component macro-expansion mechanism, both named directly in `README.md`'s "Explicitly deferred" section and now being scoped as real milestones.

**Known gaps:**
- The widget/component catalog beyond what `tre`'s own `add_*` factories expose is still real, deferred work — being scoped now (see "Up next").
- No routing beyond a plain named `App.show(name)` (no history/back-stack, no URL-style deep links); no app-level state store shared across screens; no `tesserae new` CLI scaffolding tool. All real, named, un-scoped future candidates — see `README.md`'s own "Explicitly deferred" section.
- Not published to PyPI (`tre` itself isn't fully published either yet — both depend on a local editable checkout for now).

**Fixed gaps:** none yet — this is the first real tracker entry.

## Milestone 1 — Initial App + Counter Vertical Slice

**Status: ✅ Complete (2026-09-19).** The real starting point: `App`, the single entry point owning a named `(View, ViewModel)` registry and one live `tre.Window`, per the user's own explicit design requirement ("app.py should be the entry point for the app... this allows for switching of current views without needing to bootstrap each view/viewModel"). `App.show(name)` opens the real `Window` via `tre.Window.from_view` the first time, then switches it via `tre.Window.show_view` on every call after — neither a `View` nor its `ViewModel` is ever re-parsed or re-bootstrapped by a later `show()`. `Signal`/`View`/`ViewModel` are thin, unmodified re-exports of `tre`'s own real MVVM primitives, not duplicated.

### Phase 1 — `App` + Real Vertical Slice ✅
- Step 1: `App.__init__`/`register`/`show`/`run`, backed directly by `tre.Window.from_view`/`show_view` (`src/tesserae/app.py`) — ✅
- Step 2: `examples/counter/` — a real `Counter_View.yaml` + `Counter_ViewModel.py` pair, a real dispatched click incrementing a `Signal`-bound label, through a genuine render loop — ✅
- Step 3: 5 real pytest tests for `App` itself — ✅

### Phase 2 — CI Hardening ✅
- Step 1: real CI wired up (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), checking out both `tesserae` and the sibling `tre` repo, installing `tre` editable, running `pytest`/the counter example — ✅
- Step 2: dropped the unmaintained `actions-rs/toolchain@v1` (GitHub-flagged deprecated, forced onto an old Node.js runtime) once the first real CI run surfaced the warning — `ubuntu-latest` already ships a working stable Rust toolchain, the same real finding `tre`'s own `ci.yml` already relies on — ✅

---

## Milestone 2 — `App.load()` Naming Enforcement + Multi-Screen Example

**Status: ✅ Complete (2026-09-20).** `App.load(view_path, viewmodel_cls, name=None)` — the real, runtime-enforced counterpart to the `*_View.yaml`/`*_ViewModel.py` naming convention this repo documented from its first commit but never actually checked, mirroring pyCopper's own validated design. Raises immediately on a missing suffix or a mismatched prefix, rather than failing later with an unrelated error once a handler name doesn't resolve.

### Phase 1 — Naming Enforcement ✅
- Step 1: `check_naming_convention` (`src/tesserae/naming.py`), checked via `inspect.getfile` against the `ViewModel` class's own defining file — `tre.View` has no `path` getter of its own (confirmed by reading `view.rs` before designing this), so `load()` takes the path directly — ✅
- Step 2: `App.load` wired to call it, returning the constructed `(view, viewmodel)` pair — ✅

### Phase 2 — Multi-Screen Example ✅
- Step 1: `examples/multi_screen/` — two independent screens (`Home`/`Settings`), each its own `*_View.yaml`/`*_ViewModel.py` pair, switched via `App.show()` from inside each screen's own real dispatched `on_click` handler — proving a switch works even when triggered *reentrantly*, from the handler `App.show` itself is dispatching into (the same real scenario `tre`'s own M42 Phase 2 had to fix a real borrow-panic bug for) — ✅
- Step 2: `examples/counter/` updated to use `App.load()`, dogfooding the new check — ✅
- Step 3: 5 new pytest tests for `load()`; CI runs both examples — ✅

---

## Milestone 3 — Real Component Embedding: `instantiate()` + Todo List Example

**Status: ✅ Complete (2026-09-20).** `tesserae.instantiate(parent, path, viewmodel_cls, into, *args, **kwargs)` — the enforced-naming counterpart to `tre`'s own real `View.instantiate`/`Component.instantiate` (`tre`'s M43): embeds another view's own YAML as a real, independent `Component` with its own `ViewModel`, forwarding extra constructor args for the real common case (an item's own data, or a callback letting it notify its parent on removal).

### Phase 1 — `instantiate()` ✅
- Step 1: `src/tesserae/component.py` — checks the naming convention, then calls `parent.instantiate(path, into)` (real `tre` M43 capability) and constructs `viewmodel_cls(component, *args, **kwargs)` — ✅
- Step 2: naming-convention checking factored out of `App.load` into the shared `tesserae.naming.check_naming_convention` — two real call sites justified sharing it — ✅

### Phase 2 — Todo List Example ✅
- Step 1: `examples/todo_list/` — a real dynamic list, each item its own `Component` + `ViewModel`, added via a real dispatched "Add" click and removed via its own "Remove" click, plus a real two-way-bound checkbox toggle — proves the full multi-instance lifecycle end to end through a genuine render loop — ✅
- Step 2: 4 new pytest tests for `instantiate()`; CI runs all three examples — ✅

---

## Milestone 4 — `Repeater`: Automatic Keyed List Diffing

**Status: ✅ Complete (2026-09-21).** `Repeater(parent, items_signal, path, viewmodel_cls, into, key=identity, args=lambda item: (item,))` — the declarative-*feeling* layer on top of M3's `instantiate`/`Component.remove()`: watches one list `Signal` as the single source of truth and keeps exactly one `Component` + `ViewModel` alive per item currently present, diffing by key. Built entirely in Python on top of M3's already-shipped capability — zero new `engine-spec`/`engine-core` work needed.

### Phase 1 — `Repeater` ✅
- Step 1: `src/tesserae/repeater.py` — subscribes to `items_signal`, diffs the new list's own keys against the previously-rendered set on every change: new keys call `instantiate`, keys no longer present call `component.remove()` — ✅
- Step 2: real, stated scope boundary, not silently glossed over — no reordering an already-present key (`engine_core::Tree` has no child-reorder primitive at all, confirmed by reading its source; `tre`'s own `Reconciler` carries the identical real limitation), and no re-application of a changed item's own *data* to an already-alive instance (that's the item's own `ViewModel`'s job) — ✅
- Step 3: a YAML-level `for_each:` keyword was considered and set aside — it would need a genuinely new per-item binding-resolution scoping layer in `engine-spec` (today every binding resolves against exactly one `ViewModel`-shaped object), a much bigger, riskier feature than reusing what M3 already tested — ✅ (real, deliberate, documented decision)

### Phase 2 — Todo List Rewrite + Tests ✅
- Step 1: `examples/todo_list/` rewritten onto `Repeater` — `TodoViewModel.items` is now the single source of truth (a plain list of stable ids); `TodoItemViewModel.remove_self` mutates the shared `items` `Signal` directly instead of calling `Component.remove()` via a private callback — the real single-source-of-truth pattern a repeater is for — ✅
- Step 2: 8 new pytest tests — ✅

---

## Milestone 5 — Reactivity Re-exports: `Computed`/`Effect`/`batch`/`untrack`

**Status: ✅ Complete (2026-09-21).** `tre`'s richer reactivity layer (`tre`'s own M45) is real — re-exported unmodified from `tesserae`, the same shape `Signal`/`View`/`ViewModel`/`Component` already use.

### Phase 1 — Re-export ✅
- Step 1: `Computed`/`Effect`/`batch`/`untrack` added to `src/tesserae/__init__.py`'s real, public surface — ✅
- Step 2: `README.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md`'s own "Explicitly deferred" lists updated — had also gone stale on the live-bindable-properties item, closed separately by `tre`'s own M44 with no `tesserae`-side change needed — ✅

---

## Milestone 6 — Sync with `tre` v0.3.0's `flex_direction` Rename

**Status: ✅ Complete (2026-09-23).** `tre` v0.3.0 renamed the declarative `style.flex_direction` values from `Row`/`Column` to `Horizontal`/`Vertical` — a deliberate, hard rename (the old values no longer parse), since "row"/"column" collide with the different, established meaning those words carry in spreadsheet/datasheet tools. Tesserae's own `.venv` was still on `tre` 0.2.0, and every example/test YAML in this repo used the old values — a real, concrete demonstration of exactly the "pull a new tre release and have to retest everything" problem the user's own new `tre`-side `0.3.1` release-branch workflow (accumulate multiple changes per release) exists to reduce going forward.

### Phase 1 — Update and Fix ✅
- Step 1: `tre` reinstalled editable into `tesserae/.venv` at its current `main` (v0.3.0) — ✅
- Step 2: all 7 affected files updated (`examples/counter/Counter_View.yaml`, `examples/multi_screen/Home_View.yaml`, `examples/multi_screen/Settings_View.yaml`, `examples/todo_list/Todo_View.yaml`, `examples/todo_list/TodoItem_View.yaml`, `tests/test_component.py`, `tests/test_repeater.py`) — ✅
- Step 2: verification — ✅ (22/22 pytest passing, up from 12 real failures against the stale install; all 3 real examples — `counter`/`multi_screen`/`todo_list` — run clean end to end.)

---

## Milestone 7 — Bootstrap Documentation Infrastructure

**Status: 🚧 In progress (2026-09-23).** User-directed, as part of shifting real development focus to Tesserae: "Tesserae as a new project and git/github repo should have its own documentation to include build tracker and MkDocs, along with everything else. If it is Tesserae scoped it goes in the Tesserae project." Mirrors `tre`'s own real, established documentation shape rather than a lighter-weight substitute — this file, a real MkDocs site, and `PLAN.md`/`LOG.md`, so the real widget-catalog/macro-expansion work about to start (Milestones 8+) has a real place to be tracked from the beginning.

### Phase 1 — `BUILD_TRACKER.md` ✅
- Step 1: this file, seeded with Milestones 1-6 as real, honest, after-the-fact history reconstructed from the 6 real commits already shipped — ✅
- Step 2: `tools/generate_tracker_artifact.py` copied verbatim from `tre` (the script's own header states it's project-agnostic, meant to be copied into any repo with a `BUILD_TRACKER.md` at its root) — ✅

### Phase 2 — MkDocs Site ⬜
- Step 1: `docs/`/`mkdocs.yml`, the same real structure `tre/docs/` established (Overview/Installation/Getting Started/Guide/API Reference/Architecture), scoped to what Tesserae itself provides — ⬜
- Step 2: a `docs.yml` GitHub Actions workflow mirroring `tre/.github/workflows/docs.yml` — ⬜

### Phase 3 — `PLAN.md`/`LOG.md` ⬜
- Step 1: adopted in this repo too, overwritten per phase, matching `tre`'s own already-corrected convention (no per-step archiving; `BUILD_TRACKER.md` is the durable record) — ⬜
