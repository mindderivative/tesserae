# LOG — `tre`'s Building-Block Program (M34–M43)

*(Replaces M33's log — M33 is complete, committed and pushed.)*

- User: "push it, and scope tre's building-block program". Pushed
  `78884c3`.

## Scoping

1. Read `tre`'s program on `origin/main` (`68c3883`): its tracker's
   M93–M103 and D1–D11, and `docs/design/target-api.md` (purpose, R1–R12,
   node kinds, "Rebuilding the MD3 widgets", "Tesserae's needs",
   migration table). M97 is the gate; Phase 2 Step 2 stubs out removed
   names and runs Tesserae's suite.
2. Inventoried `src/tesserae`: imports from `tre`, every `add_*`/`set_*`/
   `reconcile`/`instantiate`/`from_view`/`show_view`/`open_*` call, and
   node kinds in fragments and examples (`Rect` 44, `Text` 43,
   `Container` 42, `Icon` 23, 12 MD3 kinds).
3. Found that `engine-md3`'s color science wraps the Rust
   `material_colors` crate. The node graph is "framework" in the
   migration table.
4. Spike on 0.3.4 (2,000 box+text pairs): `create`/`set`/`add_child`
   build 9.5 ms, re-color 0.8 ms; `View(spec=)` 10.9 ms,
   `set_theme` 2.3 ms.
5. Program M34–M43 written into the tracker, with decisions P1–P8.
